## Installation from source
Prossimo was developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux, I do not have any immediate need to port it to any other OS variant so I haven't. It is written in pure Rust to hypothetically it is portable to other operating systems. I dunno, ain't tried it though.

I have not created an installer for it, so you have to build it from the source code, to do so, open a linux terminal and do the following:
`git clone  https://github.com/OGMemDC/prossimo.git`
or alternatively if you have gh installed you can 
`gh repo clone OGMemDC/prossimo`
change to the prossimo directory `cd prossimo`
then run `cargo build --release`
