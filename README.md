## Installation from source
Prossimo was developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux, I do not have any immediate need to port it to any other OS variant so I haven't. It is written in pure Rust to hypothetically it is portable to other operating systems.
1. Clone the repository `git clone  https://github.com/OGMemDC/prossimo.git` or alternatively if you have gh installed you can `gh repo clone OGMemDC/prossimo`
2. Change directory `cd prossimo`
3. Build using Cargo `cargo build --release`
