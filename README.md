## OVERVIEW

## PRE-REQUISITS

1. Linux - Prossimo was designed, developed, and tested on Ubuntu Linux. Hypothetically it will run on other operating systems but not without a bit of modifications.
2. Rust / Cargo toolchain
3. Some decent knowldge of computers, networks, and compiling rust source code. ;-)

## Installation from source

Prossimo was developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux, I do not have any immediate need to port it to any other OS variant so I haven't. It is written in pure Rust to hypothetically it is portable to other operating systems.

1. Clone the repository `git clone  https://github.com/OGMemDC/prossimo.git`
    1.1 alternatively if you have gh installed you can `gh repo clone OGMemDC/prossimo`
2. Change directory `cd prossimo`
